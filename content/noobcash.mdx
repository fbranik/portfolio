In this academic project, I implemented a cryptocurrency system using Python and a REST API. This system had several functionalities
like transaction validation with UTXOs, advanced conflict resolution and multithreaded clients (for mining and transactions).

Experiments were run on multiple VMs. Additionaly, both a cli and a lightweigth frontend were implemented. Code and further
details can be found in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fbranik/DistributedSystems).
