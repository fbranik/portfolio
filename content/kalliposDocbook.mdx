[Docbook](https://docbook.org/) is an open-source XML schema used for technical documentation. It offers the ability to produce
pdf, EPUB and HTML outputs using a common XML document base. I created a fork of Docbook along with some companion helper
applications, designed to accomodate the needs of [Kallipos](https://kallipos.gr/en/homepage/). Being one of the largest
open-access repositories in the world, Kallipos has produced over 1200 books.

My application suite includes custom publisher-level XSLT and CSS stylesheets for all the main output formats, a conversion and
preview toolkit using Qt and a VScode plugin. While these tools were made for internal use for the Kallipos initiative, a version
of them will be made public soon as an open-source project. A sample document made using these tools, is my thesis which can be found
[here](https://github.com/fbranik/FBThesis/blob/main/Documents/FotisBranikasThesisEN.pdf)
