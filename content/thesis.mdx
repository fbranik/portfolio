This thesis presents an in-depth performance analysis of a family of parallel applications for a distributed
memory architecture (a computer cluster), as well as an attempt at the compilation of a predictive performance model.
The latter is quite a complex procedure that requires a deep understanding of the phenomena that may occur
during the execution of a parallel program, which is why it was accompanied by the formerly mentioned analysis.
Î¤he compilation of a highly accurate model can be a great and highly useful achievement,
however for an HPC engineer, the journey required for this goal is itself of great importance.

The data needed for this thesis, were gathered using a custom made C benchmark that uses MPI, while the semi-empirical and machine
learning models were compiled in python using various libraries like pandas, numpy and tensorflow. You can view a web-based presentation of this thesis [here]() and some auxiliary interactive plots [here](). The full thesis, along with the final datasets and some of the developed tools can be found on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fbranik/FBThesis).
